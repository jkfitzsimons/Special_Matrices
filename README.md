# Special Cases for Matrix Inversion / Linear Solvers
A repository of matrices with special inversion properties. We are interested in matrices A, such that solving Ax = B has computational complexity under O(n^3).

[NOTE: This page is a work in progress and will never be a finished resource. If you identify any method that should be included please push to the repository. Thank you.]

## Diagnol matrices O(n)
Inverse is a diagnol matrix with each element being the inverse of the corresponding original diagnol element. 

## Block diagnol matrices O(\sum_i n_i^3)
The inverse is also is a block diagnol matrix with each block being the inverse of the corresponding block of the original matrix

## Low rank matrices

## Toeplitz matrices

## Vandamonde matrices

## Hierarchical matrices

### HODLR matrices

### Fast Multipole Methods
